# GlossaryOrder

Orders a glossary alphabetically.

### Setup

* Clone the repository
* To order the file, call the python script with a list of files you want to order.
* For convenience, add the following to your bashrc:
  ```
  alias order='~/PycharmProjects/GlossaryOrder'
  ```
* Now, whenever you want to order a file, call it with:
  ```
  order <absolute_file_path>
  ```
* Then, the specified files will now be ordered alphabetically.
